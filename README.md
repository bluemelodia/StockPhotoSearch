# StockPhotoSearch

Small practice project using JavaScript/Bootstrap CSS frontend and Node.js/Express backend. This was adapted from one of the Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Program projects, which asked students to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI in a Weather Journal application. Instead, I created an application that works with the Pexels Stock Photo API. 

    Features:
        - Users can search for stock photos. 
        - Users can bookmark their favorite photos, generate citations for crediting the photographers, preview photos, and remove photos from their list of saved photos.
        - Bookmarked photos will persist across user searches.
